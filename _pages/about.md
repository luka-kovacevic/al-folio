Second-year PhD student in Biostatistics at [Clare Hall](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk), and the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk) (BSU) under the supervision of [John Whittaker](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/staff/john-whittaker/) and [Sach Mukherjee](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/staff/sach-mukherjee/). The focus of my research is causal learning for single-cell genomics data with a particular emphasis on analysis of large-scale screening experiments. More generally, my research interests span causality, machine learning, genetics and Bayesian statistics.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked on adaptive Phase I clinical trial design at the MRC BSU. I also worked on COVID-19 epidemiological forecasting at the [S3RI](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/statistical-sciences-research-institute-s3ri) in collaboration with PHE and Dstl. I obtained an MSc in Statistical Science from the University of Oxford and a BSc in Mathematics with Computer Science from the University of Southampton.
